                    <h4>Response:</h4>
                    <p class="text">
                        &emsp;This article covers dialogue around the potential banning of a dog breed. The breed, dubbed the 
                        “XL Bully” is a pit bull-like dog breed that has been responsible for “75% of all fatal dog attacks in the UK 
                        in the past three years.” The recent controversy came after one of the XL Bully dogs attacked an 11-year-
                        old girl in Birmingham this past Saturday. Now, the girl and many other government and community 
                        officials are hoping to see heavy restrictions if not an outright ban on the breed. Politician Kit Malthouse,
                        who has a history of controlling the ownership of dangerous dogs, plans to introduce legislation that 
                        would ban the sale, import, and breeding of the breed as well as introduce “neuter and muzzle” orders 
                        for current owners. However, others claim that this level of restriction is problematic. Owen Sharp, an 
                        executive at a UK dog charity, said that not only would a ban be impractical, but it would also punish 
                        responsible families by taking away their well-behaved pets. Others, such as XL Bully owner Sophie 
                        Coulthard, call for breeding restrictions instead.

                        &emsp;This article is interesting as it closely mirrors dialogue in the US over breeds like pit bulls or 
                        Rottweilers. In the US too we see cycles of someone being attacked by a pit bull and subsequent calls for 
                        restrictions over the dog. Interestingly, there doesn’t seem to be huge support in the US for sweeping 
                        restrictions like those seen in the Telegraph article. On the other hand, while unscientific, a poll of 
                        readers inside the article showed an 80-20 split in favor of banning the XL Bully breed outright.

                    <h4>Response:</h4>
                    <p class="text">
                        &emsp;This article covers dialogue around the potential banning of a dog breed. The breed, dubbed the 
                        “XL Bully” is a pit bull-like dog breed that has been responsible for “75% of all fatal dog attacks in the UK 
                        in the past three years.” The recent controversy came after one of the XL Bully dogs attacked an 11-year-
                        old girl in Birmingham this past Saturday. Now, the girl and many other government and community 
                        officials are hoping to see heavy restrictions if not an outright ban on the breed. Politician Kit Malthouse,
                        who has a history of controlling the ownership of dangerous dogs, plans to introduce legislation that 
                        would ban the sale, import, and breeding of the breed as well as introduce “neuter and muzzle” orders 
                        for current owners. However, others claim that this level of restriction is problematic. Owen Sharp, an 
                        executive at a UK dog charity, said that not only would a ban be impractical, but it would also punish 
                        responsible families by taking away their well-behaved pets. Others, such as XL Bully owner Sophie 
                        Coulthard, call for breeding restrictions instead.
                        <br /><br />
                        &emsp;This article is interesting as it closely mirrors dialogue in the US over breeds like pit bulls or 
                        Rottweilers. In the US too we see cycles of someone being attacked by a pit bull and subsequent calls for 
                        restrictions over the dog. Interestingly, there doesn’t seem to be huge support in the US for sweeping 
                        restrictions like those seen in the Telegraph article. On the other hand, while unscientific, a poll of 
                        readers inside the article showed an 80-20 split in favor of banning the XL Bully breed outright.

                    <h3 class="author">Caleb Flegel</h3>
                    <p>
                        The startup I am covering is called Impackter. Impackter is a startup focused on the goal of sustainability. 
                        According to their about page, they aim to “Open a dialogue between Millennials and key decision makers. This 
                        is done through CULTURE, STYLE, SOCIETY and PHILANTHROPY” and their mission is to “Raise collective moral 
                        awareness through the lens of IMPAKTER”. They have multiple outlets in which they work to promote sustainability, 
                        including a news site, a sustainability index tracker, and an online marketplace. Their full-time team consists 
                        of only 10-20 staff. Despite being listed as a Wales-based startup on the wellfound website, they were founded 
                        in Rome in June 2014 by Michele Bonanno. As per their website, their main office is located in London. They 
                        currently have positions open in Rome and London (and remote), which include many journalism and business-related 
                        internships. It seems their main focus is the news/magazine portion of their business.
                        <br /> <br />
	                    The main thing seen when on impakter.com is their news section. It features many articles written by what seems 
                        like contributing journalists. While the specific topics of their articles vary, they are primarily focused on 
                        health and sustainability. Some examples of articles are “How Virtual Humans Might Help Our Lonely Elderly” and 
                        “Las Vegas ‘Sphere’: Is It Sustainable and Does it Matter?”. 
                        <br /> <br />
	                    Also featured prominently on their website, Impakter runs a sustainability index for other companies. They use a 
                        four-faceted methodology, which includes UN sustainability development goals, sustainability certificates, 
                        commitments to social responsibility, and the operations of the company. The index ranges from A to F, with A 
                        being the best. However, this section of their site is still unfinished and I could not find any actual index 
                        assignments, so it is unknown whether this is still an area of focus. 
                        <br /> <br />
	                    Finally, Impackter runs an ecology-focused marketplace on a separate website. The categories of products on the 
                        site include clothing and accessories, beauty care, and pet supplies. It seems Impackter selects brands that have 
                        an ecological focus so buyers can be sure they can consume responsibly.

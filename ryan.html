                    <h4>Response:</h4>
                    <p class="text">
                        The article I chose to discuss for this assignment is an article from The Independent entitled “Rishi Sunak 
                        and Jeremy Hunt in Talks to Scrap Phase Two of HS2 as Costs Spiral”. As the title of the article suggests, 
                        this article concerns the rumor of talks that have been occurring between Rishi Sunak (Prime Minister of 
                        the U.K.) and Jeremy Hunt (Chancellor of the Exchequer ) regarding the ambitious but time consuming HS2 rail 
                        project.
                        <br /><br />
                        &emsp;The HS2 rail project is a project to construct a rail line throughout a series of major cities in the 
                        U.K.. The idea of the project is to bring the biggest cities in the U.K. closer together through this new 
                        method of transportation that “will boost productivity, and will provide a low-carbon alternative to cars 
                        and planes for many decades to come” (Stone). In addition to this, the railway is predicted to dramatically 
                        cut down on north to south intercity travel times and to free up capacity on other operating service lines. 
                        This project was broken up into two distinct phases, neither of which have been completed yet. The first 
                        phase of the project was initially set to open in 2026. Now, thanks to delays, the entire project likely 
                        won’t be finished until 2029 (Stone). 
                        <br /><br />
                        &emsp;There is a political element to this situation too, and these politics all surround money. As one 
                        might imagine, such an endeavor would be quite expensive to achieve. According to The Independent who claims 
                        to have seen a cost estimate for the project, the U.K. government has already spent a total of £2.3bn on stage 
                        two of this project (which stretches from Birmingham to Manchester) and is expected to spend another £34bn in 
                        finishing that phase. In response to this wildly high cost estimate, some political parties (particularly the 
                        Tory MPs) have openly suggested to the Prime Minister that he put an end to the project upon the completion of 
                        phase one. The situation with the project is also concerning for the Chancellor as he faces pressure from the 
                        Tory MPs to implement tax cuts before the next election cycle. Amidst these concerns and others such as the U.K. 
                        government’s “infrastructure watchdog”’s warning in July that the project might be “unachievable”, it appears 
                        as though the Prime Minister and Chancellor have entered talks that may lead to the scrapping of the second 
                        part of phase two (called phase 2b) as phase 2a has already been approved by parliament and would be difficult 
                        to stop (Stone). 
                        <br /><br />
                        &emsp;I found this article very interesting and insightful as it gives a peek behind the curtain regarding some 
                        of the U.K.’s current government innerworkings. This article reveals that, similar to the U.S., the topic of 
                        government budgets is very prevalent in the U.K.. The idea of a massive government sponsored project that quickly 
                        gets out of control and begins eating away at tons of money is an idea that Americans know all too well, so it is 
                        nice to see that the U.K. also encounters these same issues.
                        <br /><br />
                        &emsp;The other thing that I found fascinating about this article was the idea that citizens in parliament seem 
                        to have open access to ask the Prime Minister questions on a semi-regular basis. The article mentions that Michael 
                        Fabricant, representing the Tory MPs, asked the Prime Minister to scrap phase two of the HS2 point blank at an event 
                        called “Prime Minister’s Questions” (Stone). Doing a quick Google search reveals that Prime Minister’s Questions is 
                        a ticketed event that takes place every Wednesday at noon where members of parliament can ask the Prime Minister 
                        questions regarding policy while U.K. citizens (and also foreign visitors, if space permits) can watch (Prime 
                        Minister’s Questions). This event intrigues me as it demonstrates a willingness of the Prime Minister to grant 
                        others frequent open access to himself. This event also seems to serve as a way for regular citizens of the U.K. 
                        to watch and get an understanding of how the U.K. government operates which seems like an incredibly unique 
                        opportunity that a lot of other countries’ governments do not offer.
